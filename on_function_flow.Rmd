# Some thoughts on function flows

Length based:

* By station:
    - Calculate for a complete length range
    - Raise by counted
    - Convert to biomass via lwcoefficient
    - Standardize by tow / trim tow
    - Standardize by area swept

```    
mytable <- function(x, ...) x %>% group_by_(...) %>% summarise(n = n())
mytable(mtcars, c("cyl"))
mytable(mtcars, ~cyl)
mytable(mtcars, c("gear"))
mytable(mtcars, "cyl", "gear")
mytable(mtcars, ~cyl, ~gear)
```
