# Preamble

... pax: population analysis in unix. This is a resuscitation of an old name - but likely going to do more.

__Needed packages__:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("fishvice/husky", dependencies = FALSE) # A temporary measure
devtools::install_github("fishvice/pax", dependencies = FALSE)
```

In addition it is (still) assumed you have the __fjolst__-package.
